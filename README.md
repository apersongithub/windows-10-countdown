## **🎮 How to Play**

#### **For the best experience play on PC**

*❗To get to the game to unlock wait for the countdown to end **OR** `Double Tab` the QR code / click `Insert`.*

*If you are on mobile you may have to change your `Zoom Level`.*

Use the cursor to navigate the Taskbar's limited vertical axis and intercept the incoming code blocks. Avoid any hazards at all costs (unless you are fighting the boss).
